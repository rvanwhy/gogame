gogame -- The Game of Go
======

Here is my attempt to make the backbone for applications that want
to play the game of go.

The Board
====
The plan is to create a virtual board smart enough to evauluate captures
and detect illegal moves (Ko and Suicide). 

The Future
====
Hopefully, if all goes well. This backbone will be able to parse
sgf formats and display games in some manner.
